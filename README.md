##Installation Guide

Make sure your server has atleast 1GB of Ram or else MySQL may not install.

1. Have a server setup with Ruby on Rails. 
  * Following instructions for a system with Unicorn and Nginx pre-installed.
2. Run: `sudo apt-get update`
3. Install MySQL
  * Run: `sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev`
4. Set Database Password
  * `PhotographyPortfolio\config\database.yml`
5. Configure Action Mailer (emails) to an existing GMail account:
  * `PhotographyPortfolio/config/environments`
  * Edit :user_name and :password
  * Specify `to` address: `/PhotographyPortfolio/app/mailers/contact_mailer.rb`
6. Install Gems
  * Run: `bundle install`
7. Create Production DB
  * Run: `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create`
8. Create Tables
  * Run: `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production`
9. Install imagemagick
  * Run: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`
10. Generate devise key
  * Run: `RAILS_ENV=production rake secret`
  * Paste results for production in `PhotographyPortfolio/config/secrets.yml`
11. Modify
  * Run: `nano /etc/default/unicorn`
  * Change: 
  ```ruby
  APP_ROOT=/home/rails/rails_project
  ```
  To
  ```ruby
  APP_ROOT=/home/rails/PhotogrphyPortfolio
  ```
12. Restart unicorn and stop nginx service
  * Run: `service unicorn restart`
  * Run: `service nginx stop`
13. Run your project
  * Run: `rails server -e production -p 80`
14. Open your website in your web browser.

##RailsAdmin

* RailsAdmin is a Content Management Environment
* Two gems, Paperclip and Imagemagick, added to allow file upload, scale, and image cropping.
* Access RailsAdmin: {yourwebsite url}/admin
* You can disable user registration by visisting `\PhotographyPortfolio\app\models\user.rb` and comment out ```ruby :registerable ```. Remeber to comment out the comma in front of it as well.
* Restart the process.
* To crop image: Navigate to image -> Edit -> Click image -> Drag + Drop + Save area you want shown.
* Cropping feature is a little flaky. If an overlay image doesn't appear, refresh.

##Making Album display image
 Each album has an album cover. After you create album, you will need to edit and specify which picture associated with the album for album cover.

##Running Your Server in the Background
* If you close your terminal, you may kill your server process.
* Stop nginx as it may conflict with 'Screen'. Run: `service nginx stop`
* Run: `screen rails server -e production -p 80`
* Keep in mind if you need to restart your project, you may need to kill your process.

##UI Customziations
* Code for About: `\PhotographyPortfolio\app\views\home\about.html.erb`

##FAQ

Killing Rails process
* Go to `tmp/pids` and delete server.pids
* Run: `ps aux | grep rails`

* All else fails, restart server
